# Mistakes

We will start with an analyse of my mistakes:
1. I received an invitation via bitbucket. I had no account there with this e-mail. I should have created the account first, before opening the invitation (the 2 hours timer started once I opened the bucket). Because I did not know the password to `git clone` the folder, I lost a considerable amount of time setting up an SSH in bitbucket to be able to clone the project. Once this was done, I rushed into the tasks that were given to me and that led me to the following points
2. The first obvious mistake is that I edited the css file in the __css__ folder. When it was clearly stipulated in the don'ts that this should not be edited.
3. The second mistake is that I changed the html file when I was asked not to change it (to add async)
4. The second mistake I made was to be a bit un-prepared. I was told before end that I might need a web server to serve the static files. I have not prepared anything of that sort and that turned out to be a problem when I reached the point where I needed one. I should have at least prepared some static file server before I opened the link.
5. I spent too much time on small and probably useless details. The opacity gradient and the overlay color were probably not worth the time I spent trying to be as accurate to the image as possible.
